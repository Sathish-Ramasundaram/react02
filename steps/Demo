🧠 What This Project PROVES

You didn’t just “make pages”.

You demonstrated:

How React works internally

How routing works in SPAs

How forms are handled properly

How architecture is planned before features

How real projects are structured

This is far beyond beginner level.

🔜 What We’ll Do Next (When You’re Ready)

Next logical steps (in order):

Add isAuthenticated state to Context

Protect Dashboard route

Redirect after login

API mock integration

Whenever you’re ready, just say:

“Continue with auth logic”

You’ve done really solid work 👏
